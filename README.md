![Banner](./apps/web/asset/banner.png)

A universal text component with a gradient overlay that works on web and mobile. Under the hood, the library has dependencies on `expo-linear-gradient` & `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view`. As a result, you will need Expo Modules to be setup for bare RN projects. On web, text gradients are done with CSS.

### Installation

```
yarn add universal-text-gradient
```
